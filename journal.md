The last week was mostly about exploration. Though initially, I knew that working on Tracking
Carbon Emission would be my goal for this semester, I didnâ€™t really arrive at how I was going to
achieve it. Machine Learning of course is one fascinating topic that I would be prepared work
with countless hours. I was looking for a sector to apply this to. My background is in Electrical
Engineering and I have done quite a lot with energy per se, Hence working with energy again
would be interesting. I skimmed through the internet for datasets, looked for meaningful data
and found the website which is " ourworldindata". It is an interesting website and I am looking
forward to working with the data I obtained from there

As a part of the data exploration process, this week I started off with understanding the concepts of Time Series Analysis.I have now a strong hold on concepts such as persistence model, ADF test, Autocorrelation, Partial Auto Correlation and ARIMA. As weekly dicussions have also included a variety of concepts like Linear Inverse Modelling , I wanted to see if this concept could be applied to the current case. However, due to the limitations in the method, I think the concept cannot be applied to my study. Overall, I am looking forward to applying these concepts to the dataset.

This week was more about, data cleaning and pre-processing. I dedicated majority of my time to understanding the variables and analysisng how the data can be used for further analysis. Initially, I thought that I might want to collect data from the source and simply predict how much of the green house gas emission scenario would change over the course of time for countries around the world. But in order to arrive at this, I realized that the current dataset would not serve the purpose, mainly because there are plenty of missing values within the dataset itself. I tried several procedures to correct the dataset but they still seem to be ineffective.

I was able to overcome the hiccup in the last week and now my data seems to be ready for analysis. I fit the dataset to the baseline model. Now I am looking to explore it with all the methods that I have studied in week 2. Hopefully,, this should bring out some insight.

After attending the Class today, my curiosity was piqued by the concept of Causality. I realized that my project could extend into something bigger.
What if Energy Demand could have a causal relationship with Social Media Sentiments(Priya mentioned that Social-Media Sentiments is a good avenue to extend energy research into)

Essentially, I would wanna delve deeper into whether "Do the spikes in energy demand on certain days of the year have a causal relationship with trending media topics?"
This looks like a good study to focus on.

Up until now my progress is as follows:

- I realized that the dataset that I already have is wanting.
Hence I explored further for a more meaningful dataset and foind the EIA website.
The EIA website has more structured data. I was able to retrieve the Energy Demand Data for New York from 2015-2022.

- This dataset was relatively clean. However, I did spend time to refine it further and save it to csv formats.

- I spent time to preprocess the data and did some basic data exploration.

- I applied to to a moderaltely strong ARIMA model and tried to select best hyperparameters for the same.
